          "These terms apply to all legal acts of STB, the contract we concluded
          with you and your use of our platform. If any of these terms change
          you will be informed as soon as possible."

        <h4 class="fw-bold mt-5">Account</h4>
        <p>
          In order to make use of the Platform, the Tour Operator shall enter
          into an Agreement with STB, to which Agreement these Terms and
          Conditions apply. To enter into an Agreement, the Tour Operator shall
          follow STB 's registration process. The Tour Operator warrants that
          all information provided during this process is up-to-date, correct
          and complete. If the (company) data submitted by the Tour Operator is
          at any point no longer up-to-date, correct or complete, the Tour
          Operator shall modify or complete the required data. The Tour Operator
          is not allowed to register an Account on behalf of another entity or
          person.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the registration process the Tour Operator is required to enter
          all information requested by STB before an Account is created on its
          behalf, which includes information about cancellation, location,
          contact information and the Tour Operator's terms and conditions, as

        </p>
        <p>
          The Tour Operator is responsible for maintaining secrecy with regard
          to its Login Details. As soon as the Tour Operator knows or has reason
          to suspect that its Login Details have come into the hands of
          unauthorized persons, the Tour Operator must inform STB of this
          without delay, without prejudice to its own obligation to immediately
          take effective action, such as changing its Login Details.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tour Operator is at all times responsible and liable for the use
          of the Platform by third parties through its Account. The Tour
          Operator indemnifies STB against any and all damage and costs arising
          from and/or related to the access to and/or the use of the Platform by
          third parties through the Tour Operator's Account.

        <h4 class="fw-bold">Use of the Platform</h4>
        <p>
          If the Tour Operator complies in full with all obligations pursuant to
          these Terms and Conditions, STB will grant the Tour Operator a
          limited, personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and
          non-transferable right to use the Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the best of its ability, STB will make efforts to provide the
          Platform with due care. The Tour Operator accepts that the Platform,
          only contains the functionalities and other characteristics as it
          contains at the moment of the Tour Operator's use (“as is” and “as
          available”). Each and every use of the Platform is for its own risk
          and responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          STB is at all times, without in any way becoming liable to the Tour
          Operator, entitled to make procedural and technical alterations and/or
          improvements to the Platform, including the available payment process.

          STB may at any time impose quality standards upon the Tour Operator,
          including but not limited to standards regarding technical
          requirements, information level and requirements regarding the
          Experience Offers and/or services offered by the Tour Operator to
          Users. STB may at any time amend or supplement these standards and can
          – at its sole discretion – (temporarily) block the Tour Operator's
          Account if these standards are not met.
        </p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">The Tour Operator is not entitled to:</h4>
        <p>
          make Content available that is in any way unlawful or infringes the
          rights of STB and/or third parties, including – but not limited to –
          IP Rights and rights that relate to the protection of privacy;

        <p>
          If, after completing an Experience Offer, a User’s experience
          materially and objectively differed in a negative sense (to be
          assessed by STB) from the experience suggested by the Tour Operator in
          its Experience Offer due to the Tour Operators violation of article
          3.6e, the Tour Operator shall refund the total amount paid by the User
          for the Reservation. In addition, STB shall be entitled to suspend or
          delete the Tour Operators Account or impose additional requirements
          for subsequent Experience Offers.
        </p>
        <p>
          STB reserves the right to modify, refuse or delete Content, in
          particular in - but not limited to - the events such Content is

        </p>

          If the Tour Operator is of the opinion that certain content offered by
          another Tour Operator or that is otherwise available on the Platform

          Operator shall notify STB thereof.

        <p>
          " STB can in no way be held liable if issues (however unlikely) arise
          between you and users. This includes for instance your responsibility
          to make sure their personal data is protected. Any quality standards
          imposed by us have to be complied with at all times. You have to be
          honest about the experience you offer: you will have to refund payment
          if you submit misleading information (for example, you cannot charge
          any additional fee before or during the experience and your
          accommodation should meet the specifications you submit). And finally,
          you cannot use our site in any inappropriate way such as making
          available content that infringes on the intellectual property of STB

          which will remain in full force and effect.
        </p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold mt-5">Experience Offers and Reservations</h4>
        <p>
          The Tour Operator acknowledges and accepts that the Experience Offers
          are automatically processed by STB and the Tour Operator itself is
          solely responsible for (the repair of) any inaccuracies and/or
          inconsistencies in the Experience Offers displayed in the Platform.
          The Tour Operator is fully liable for all claims from Users and/or
          third parties related to (Reservations made due to) an incorrect
          Experience Offer and shall indemnify STB from all claims in this
          respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tour Operator is not entitled to apply higher prices on the
          Platform than the prices listed on its own website for the same
          Experience Offers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tour Operator is entitled to apply its own (booking) terms &
          conditions to a Reservation. However, the contents of these terms &
          conditions, as well as the application and enforcement thereof are the
          sole responsibility of the Tour Operator. The Tour Operator's terms
          and conditions shall not conflict with any provision of these Terms
          and Conditions, and the provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall
          prevail in case of such conflict. STB reserves its right to reject the
          applicability of a Tour Operator's terms & conditions or specific
          provisions thereof. In such case, Tour Operator shall either adjust
          its terms & conditions as to meet STB 's requirements or remove the
          terms & conditions from the Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case a Reservation is made through the Platform, STB is responsible
          only for forwarding the relevant reservation information as submitted
          by the User and for sending a confirmation (email) to the User.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tour Operator acknowledges and accepts that a Reservation of the
          User constitutes a binding agreement between the Tour Operator and
          User. The Tour Operator is fully responsible for the implementation
          and execution of such agreement, including support services/help desk
          et cetera. However, the Tour Operator is not permitted to share its
          contact details with the User. STB shall never become a party to an
          agreement between the Tour Operator and User.
        </p>
        <p>
          In providing the Platform, STB provides support to the Tour Operator's
          as well as to the Users. However, STB can never be held to provide
          support services to any User regarding a Reservation. If STB deems it
          necessary that a Tour Operator contacts a User regarding an Experience
          Offer or a Reservation, the Tour Operator shall immediately do so. If
          the Tour Operator's support services to Users do not meet STB 's
          quality standards, STB is entitled to (temporarily) block or remove
          the Tour Operator's Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case the User cancels a Reservation in accordance with the Tour
          Operator's terms and conditions, the Tour Operator shall notify STB of
          such cancellation as soon as possible. If the Tour Operator fully
          reimburses the User for the Reservation, the commission fee shall also
          be reimbursed by STB. If the Tour Operator does not fully refund the
          amount paid by the User for the Reservation, STB shall be entitled to
          retain the commission fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case a Reservation has been cancelled and the User has paid through
          the Platform, the Tour Operator shall also process the refund through
          the Platform. STB is never responsible or liable in case the Tour
          Operator processes this refund directly to the User. The Tour Operator
          shall be liable for any loss of STB in the event the Tour Operator
          acts contrary to the provisions of this paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Tour Operator cancels a User's Reservation due to a cause
          attributable to the Tour Operator, the Tour Operator shall at all
          times fully refund all amounts paid by the User for the Reservation.
          In addition, the Tour Operator shall compensate the User for all other
          costs and damages incurred in relation to the Reservation. The Tour
          Operator is never entitled to deviate from its statutory obligations
          regarding liability resulting from its for non-performance vis-à-vis a
          User.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case the Tour Operator shortens the Experience Offer for any
          reason, the Tour Operator shall offer the User at least a (partial)
          refund, which refund is proportional to the shortened Experience
          Offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Tour Operator has failed to deliver the package as described in
          the list on the Website, Tour Operator shall offer the User at least a
          (partial) refund.
        </p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">In other words:</h4>
        <p>
          "We process the offers you place on our website automatically, which
          makes you responsible for the correctness of the information in the
          offer and liable for any claims that can arise out of incorrect
          information. If you wish to apply your terms and conditions to
          agreements with users you should upload them to your account. Any of
          your offers accepted by the user will result in a binding contract
          between you and the user, and failures could result in a refund to the
          user. If an offer is cancelled by a user you should notify us as soon
          as possible."
        </p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold mt-5">Payment</h4>
        <p>
          The use of the Platform by the Tour Operator is free of charge. When
          making a Reservation, the User shall be required to pay a deposit,
          which is a percentage of the total amount of the value of the
          Reservation. STB shall be entitled to determine a minimum amount of a
          deposit to be requested from a User for a specific Reservation.
        </p>
        <p>
          STB shall reserve a commission fee for its services, which shall be a
          percentage of the total price due for a specific Reservation by a
          User. This commission fee will apply in case the first point of
          contact between the User and Tour Operator is through the Platform.
          The applicable commission percentage shall at all times be indicated
          to the Tour Operator before the Tour Operator publishes a Experience
          Offer. STB shall be entitled to adjust the applicable commission,
          which it shall at all times indicated to the Tour Operator in advance.
          The Tour Operator shall be entitled to remove its Experience Offers
          and/or its Account if it does not agree with such adjusted commission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon payment of a Reservation through the Platform by a User, STB
          shall deduct the commission fee from this amount.
        </p>
        <p>
          If (part of) the commission fee of STB is paid directly to the Tour
          Operator, STB reserves the right to withhold the amounts due and
          payable from future User payments the Tour Operator has through STB.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the transfer of funds paid by Users to the Tour Operator's bank
          account, STB may incur transaction costs. STB shall be entitled to
          charge such costs to the Tour Operator in accordance with the
          principles agreed with Tour Operator in its Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          STB may impose requirements in relation to the minimum balance which
          can be transferred to the Tour Operator's bank account per
          transaction, which requirements shall be set out on the Platform.
        </p>
